from fellow testers:
- project names! (find from gh str)
- malteds map is heavuly broken such as:
takes to long to load (cut more programs from being loaded or load last 365 days)
u can click thru the globe
can phase thru the land
- api keys instead of cookies (cookies will still work, api keys fallback)
- round the hours vro
- optomize speeds
- on docs page dont turbo redirect (turbo is casuing a js error)
- dupe countries, top projects (should go away after name) 
- improve caching
from me:
- add webhook slack dm option
- api webhook maybe for on new entry
- airtable webhook to server setup
- expolode?
